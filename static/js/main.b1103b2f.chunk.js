Scatterplots are a common way to get a sense of interesting patterns and distributions between two variables. Releasing scatterplots without privacy addition is not possible because the points correspond to individuals.

To fix this problem we have experts evaluate the utility of the private scatterplots. Using these metrics we compare 5 popular differential privacy algorithms across a range of data sets, tasks, bins sizes, and privacy levels.
