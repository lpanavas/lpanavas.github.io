Other privacy additions such as anonymity or jittering the data do not necessarily preserve the privacy of the individuals. Differential privacy is a mechanism that does guarantee privacy against a broad range of attacks in a quantifiable way.

We match the visual characteristics to certain tasks users may want to complete with scatterplots to help data curators discern which type of algorithm is best for them to use when presenting private data visually."
